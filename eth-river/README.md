(This README is intentionally minimal.)

Test data guidance
- Small or example PCAPs for tests: put them under `tests/fixtures/pcap/` and commit.
- Large or sensitive captures: keep them outside the repo under `test-data/pcap/` (the repo already lists `test-data/` in `.gitignore`).

See `TEST_DATA.md` for details on layout and recommended usage.
